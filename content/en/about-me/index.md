ðŸ‘‹ Chenxuan here.  Welcome, and thanks for visiting!

I started diy hacking in 2020 with my wife. We upcycled a ikea ladder to an easel.
My DIY projects went over and bigger. Through doing myself, I learned how things work and demystify complex concepts.
Besides saving me some money from hiring professionals to finish the job, I earned gratification from building thiings from concept design, refine and finish.
