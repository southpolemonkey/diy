After the drainage was completed, we started design the paving pattern. 
Considering this side lane will be occasionally used as a service channel for machine to travel, we decidede to use 50mm thick paver to best support the weight to avoid crack.

## Materials

From the area, we would need 1 cubic meter of sand and 200kg cement. I hired a pick-up truck from bunnings and bought the materials from [martins landscaping supplies](https://www.martinsbls.com.au/), they are based in dural and quite nice guys.
We ordered the sandstone paver from [Simon Seconds](https://www.simonsseconds.com.au/).

## Paving

After considering several options, we decided to go with a Random Flagging pattern. With everything prepared, we started the work immediately.

My father-in-law was responsible for preparing the mortar, while I was in charge of arranging the pattern.
The first day was quite simple. On the second day, we began to worry that the existing bricks were too square to create a random pattern. On the third day, we had a technical breakthrough and learned to use an angle grinder to cut the stones, allowing us to cut any shape we wanted.

We spent a total of a week figuring out the pattern and details, with everyone in the family contributing their ideas.
Seeing the completed work gave us a great sense of accomplishment.

## Result

We transformed a once muddy area with weeds into a nice lovely area that can further be delighted with some mural on the fence.
We turned one of the window into a mini bar where I can serve drinks and snacks.
